# MindSqualls
This code is owned by Niels K. Handest and he has asked me to upload his work here
on GitHub. I am currently working on a new and updated version of this library but
as this will take some time MindSqualls will be available here.

I have had a small email conversation with Niels and he has pointed out some issues
with the latest version of his code that he would've liked to fix. He did also
want to add support for the EV3 kit but due to other commitments he has no time to
work on this anymore.

Find the latest version of MindSqualls in [releases](https://github.com/LucariMewTwo/MindSqualls/releases). The original code is also
available on the [MindSqualls website](http://www.mindsqualls.net/)

My updated library is Mindstorms Sharp
