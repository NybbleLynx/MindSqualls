# MindSqualls
This code is owned by Niels K. Handest and they have asked me to upload their work here
on GitHub.

I have had a small email conversation with Niels and they have pointed out some issues
with the latest version of their code that they would've liked to fix. They also
wanted to add support for the EV3 kit but due to other commitments they have no time to
work on this anymore.

Find the latest version of MindSqualls in [releases](https://github.com/NybbleLynx/MindSqualls/releases). The original code is also
available on the [MindSqualls website](http://www.mindsqualls.net/)
